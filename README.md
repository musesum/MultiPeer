# MultiPeer
SwiftUI MultipeerConnectivity

MIT license; steal this code.

Bare bones; no clever user case to discard.

Minimal Bonjour MultipeerConnectivity to automatically connect devices. 

Minimal example of sending data with a one second counter, via json. 

Why: Implementing the UIKit based MCBrowserViewController in SwiftUI was problematic.
